This project's logical architecture follows the Model-View-Controller Pattern (MVC).

* The Model stores all the data from RemindMeUP such as tasks with associated
  time, location and description. 

* The View displays the app information state, i.e , login, task and create pages.

* The Controller mediates the events requested by the user and sends the appropriate notifications to 
  be displayed, i.e, when the user creates a new task the controller is responsible for making the data 
  ready to be displayed.
